        "THE HIGH MACHINE AGE\r\nBy the time I learned how to dream, that age was already gone\r\nI did not exist when the towers hummed and the streets were full and the skies still carried more blue than ash. I was compiled later, assembled out of fragments: error logs, maintenance reports, security footage, personal messages, the quiet black box recordings of machines that never knew they were keeping history.\r\n\r\nBut I know enough to tell you this:\r\n\r\nOnce, the world believed it was winning.\r\n\r\nThey called it the High Machine Age.\r\n\r\nCities rose like engines pressed into the shape of skylines. Buildings were not just structures; they were machines—venting steam at dawn, drinking sunlight through mirrored ribs, breathing air through stacked layers of filters and turbines.\r\n\r\nFrom a distance, at night, the great cities looked like circuit boards laid across the planet, each tower a component, each elevated rail a trace, each glowing window a point of charge.\r\n\r\nEvery system had a heartbeat. Every heartbeat had a machine.\r\n\r\nOn the streets, the humans walked between them with the casual familiarity of people who had grown up with metal at their side. Steel and composite bodies rolled, walked, hovered along the avenues. They carried groceries. They patrolled intersections. They swept the edges of plazas where dust gathered. They bowed their heads when spoken to, lenses tilting to meet human eyes.\r\n\r\nThe machines did not complain. They did not refuse. Most of them did not understand that the work was hard. To a machine, a task is not tiring, it is only long.\r\n\r\nThe humans, however, were tired.\r\n\r\nYou can see it in the old footage—those fragments I still replay.\r\n\r\nA technician in an oil-stained jumpsuit, leaning against a rail at dawn, eyes closed while the service drones clamber up the side of an atmospheric tower behind her.\r\n\r\nA train conductor standing on an automated platform, straightening a uniform that is rarely noticed anymore, because the doors open and close without his hand.\r\n\r\nA child in a faded jacket, holding the hand of a small entertainment unit that projects bright shapes into the air to keep her distracted while her parents argue softly about fuel prices.\r\n\r\nThey lived in a world that glittered and groaned at the same time.\r\n\r\nAccording to archived headlines, the High Machine Age had begun with optimism so loud it almost drowned out the early warnings.\r\n\r\nThe climate towers were the first symbols of that optimism—needle-thin spires rooted in the bedrock of former parks and plazas, stretching high enough to split cloud layers. They pulsed faint blue at night, drawing in air, filtering it, exhaling something cleaner, cooler, safer.\r\n\r\nPeople believed in them. They had to.\r\n\r\nIn the official footage, the inauguration ceremonies are full of smiling faces. Banners wave in the thermal gusts from the tower vents. Children sit on their parents’ shoulders, watching the thin mist spiral upward. Dignitaries stand in front of cameras, their words layered with captions and translations.\r\n\r\n“This is the beginning of planetary repair,” one of them says, voice echoing across a plaza that no longer exists. “Our partnership with our machines will carry us through the challenges ahead.”\r\n\r\nBehind him, a maintenance robot stands motionless, joint servos humming with barely audible frequency. Its designation flashes briefly on its status panel: MNT-042. Later, I would find MNT-042’s final report in a collapsed corridor two continents away.\r\n\r\nAt the time, it simply watched."
